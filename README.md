Bubbles
=======

OS X SpriteKit demo that recreates the iOS 7 dynamic wallpaper effect. Includes an NSColorWell control that uses KVO to dynamically change the background color. Demonstrates use of SKEffectNode and SKShapeNode to programmatically create a visually interesting effect. Number of draw calls could be optimized further by making SKShapeNodes into textured sprites.
